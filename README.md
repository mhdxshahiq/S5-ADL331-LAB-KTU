Practice Questions
1. Write a Python script to generate a list of random numbers and find their mean and
standard deviation.
2. Consider the river temperature data available at
https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/documents/b8a985f5-30b5-4234-9a62-03de60bf31f7. Create a
Python script to select only the data from "Swale at Catterick Bridge" location, and find the
mean temperature and median dissolved oxygen. Also plot a histogram showing the
distribution of temperature over the time period of study.

3. Consider the river temperature data available at
https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/documents/b8a985f5-30b5-4234-9a62-03de60bf31f7. Create a
Python script to perform linear regression to establish how temperature affects dissolved
oxygen levels. Test the model on the whole dataset and find the RMSE.
4. Perform logistic regression to classify Cleveland heart disease dataset. Print the featureimportance and accuracy. Drop least important attributes one by one and assess how the
accuracy and feature importance changes.
5. Find the correlation and covariance between different attributes of Cleveland heart disease
dataset. Which are the top 5 attributes closely related to the predicted attribute?
6. Perform Naive Bayes classification on the "glass" dataset from Kaggle. Interpret the
performance of the classifier, and evaluate why the accuracy value is what you obtained.
7. Use the "Car Evaluation Dataset" from UCI Machine Learning repository to generate a
decision tree and measure the performance.
8. Implement KNN algorithm to classify iris dataset. Print all necessary performance
measures.
9. Implement appropriate CNNs to classify (i) MNIST dataset, and (ii) Fashion MNIST
dataset. Redesign the CNN with different hyperparameters and evaluate the performance.
10. Implement dimensionality reduction on Car Evaluation dataset from UCI Machine
Learning repository using PCA. Try setting number of PCA components from 2 to 5,
and identify the composition that gives the best performance among all of them. Find
covariance among
